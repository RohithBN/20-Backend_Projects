# Vendor directory (if you use Go modules, this might be committed, but often ignored for older projects or specific workflows)
vendor/

# Go module cache (usually in GOPATH/pkg/mod)
# This is typically outside the project directory, but can be configured
# to be within the project, in which case it should be ignored.
# You might want to ignore the whole go.mod/go.sum if you're not using modules,
# or specific files if they are generated.
# For typical Go module usage, go.mod and go.sum should be committed.
